## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the Storytel's Frontend challenge. I was expected to develop a well-structured message board application using any design I want. The app should include the following features:

- **a user can create a message in the service**
- **a user can create a child-message in the service**
- **the same user can modify their message**
- **the same user can delete their message**
- **a user can view any message available**
- **add test to critical places of the code (OPTIONAL)**

It is a SPA(Single Page Application) message board app in React-Redux.
It was created using [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/) and depends on the backend API Server, which interact with the front-end portion of the project. This React/Redux app is a message board allowing users to post, edit, comment, and delete.
