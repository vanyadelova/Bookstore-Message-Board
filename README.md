## What this project is about
This is my own attempt at the Storytel's Frontend challenge. I was expected to develop a well-structured message board application using any design I want. The app should at minimum support the following primary functions:

- **List a number of movies**
- **Search for a movie by title**
- **Filter movies by different genres**
- **Navigate to a specific movie as to preview further details**
- **Should be interactive to numerous resolutions**

It is a SPA(Single Page Application) app to browse movies written in React-Redux.
The data is grabbed from the Movie DB - https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api.


## Run it locally ðŸ–¥

Clone the repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vanyadelova/movie-library-application.git
```
Install and start the API backend server.

```
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

Install project dependencies and start the app.

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

Your browser should automatically open `localhost:3000` Enjoy the app!
